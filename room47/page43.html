        <h2>You jump for the book.</h2>

        <p> 
            You just manage to graze the bottom edge. Not enough to grab it, 
            but enough to knock it loose.
        </p>

        <p> 
            In midair, the pages spread open and you find the book racing 
            down towards you, open like a maw. You brace yourself as it hits 
            you...
        </p>

        <p>
            ...And envelops you? 
        </p>

        <p>And you find yourself falling through endless pages.</p>

        <p>Eventually, you tumble free of the endless fluttering mess.</p>
