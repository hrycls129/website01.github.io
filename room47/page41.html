        <h2>Sizzling.</h2>

        <p> 
            You arrive in a kitchen. It is in full swing. Water boils, burgers 
            char, and a mass of eggs fry--just one shy of four dozen. Curiously, 
            not a single person is around to attend to things. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A nearby shelf bulges with cookbooks. One with a blue cover hangs 
            just on the edge of falling.
