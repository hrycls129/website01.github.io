        <h2>Fwumf!</h2>

        <p>
            You land on something fluffy and white. Looking around, it 
            seems to extend out in every direction--even upwards! Your entire 
            field is a uniform rolling white. Is this a... cloud? A massive 
            plushie? A metaphor for running out of ideas? Whatever it is, you 
            notice a little splash of colour sticking out of the otherwise 
            blank plains.
