        <h2>*Sniff*</h2>

        <p>
            You take a wiff of a nearby blossom. The smell is sweet and 
            delicate, and you can't help but want lean in further. With your 
            nose buried almost entirely within the petals, you brush up 
            against something...

        <h3>You found Sticker #4!</h3>
