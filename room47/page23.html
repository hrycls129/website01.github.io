        <h2>A neutral glow.</h2>

        <p>
            The light through the windows is soft and natural. It is also the 
            only thing that is visible: Everything is a uniform blank glow. 
            You try looking outside, but none of the glass panes seem to open, 
            and there's no doors either.
        </p>
