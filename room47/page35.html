        <h2>An impressive fortress.</h2>

        <p> 
            When you have the energy to look around, you find yourself on
            an island not surrounded by sea, but by thick glass walls. These 
            walls now hold up the surf, looming far above your head. Within 
            the sea, through the glass, you can see a massive castle, shimmering in the waves.   
        </p>

        <p>The sun beats down on you.</p>
