        <h2>The light grows.</h2>

        <p>
            Pink becomes white. The heat is inescapable. The tunnel grows 
            steeper, and before you realize it, you're in freefall. 
        </p>

        <p>
            It isn't long before you land lightly, feet first, on what feels 
            like soft earth. 
        </p>
