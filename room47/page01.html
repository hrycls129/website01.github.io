        <h1>"There is no Escape from Room 47"</h1>

        <p>
            The message is scrawled in black paint over the door to this room,
            the 47th room of the 47th floor. "No Escape?" Strange, didn't you 
            just come through that door?  
        </p>

        <p>
            There is also a small slip of paper on the ground. It says 
            "Credits".
