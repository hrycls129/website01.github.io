            You open your eyes... And you are free. You have been, this whole 
            time. The room melts away like a bad dream, and in its place... 
            anything you can think of.

            Ending 5/5: The true ending?

            They're all true, but this one's the last one. Maybe that makes it 
            true-er... until Escape from Room 47 *2* babyyyyyy that's right 
            I'm getting that sequel money (jk lol that's not happening)
