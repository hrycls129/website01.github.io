        <h2>The Pit of Soft Things.</h2>

        <p>
            A closer inspection reveals that the water is all soft fabric: 
            plushies and towels and pillows, all in varying shades of blue. 
            In the distance, you can make out a small island. Elsewhere... 
            infinite blue.
        </p>
