        <h2>You take a deep breath.</h2>

        <p>
            The air is thick, not just with humidity, but with smell. Dirt and 
            sweetness and the sense of thriving life. Brightly coloured flowers 
            fill the room. Roses, tulips, gracidea, every plot holds a new
            type of bloom. Light shines through glass panes, from... outside? 
            Weren't you underground?
        </p>
