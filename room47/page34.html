        <h2>An impressive fortress.</h2>

        <p> 
            The glass gives way like light curtains, and you walk easily 
            through the depths. Soon, you are wandering the cold stone 
            passageways of an old castle. 
        </p>

        <p>
            You arrive at a door which bristles with energy. Behind it, you 
            can hear the rustle and banter of busy people, and the smell of 
            cooking food fills the air.
