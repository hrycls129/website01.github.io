        <h2>You make your way through the tunnel.</h2>

        <p>
            The tunnel angles downwards, slowly at first, and then more and 
            more strongly. Eventually, you reach a point where you're not sure 
            you'll be able to get back if you go any further.
        </p>

        <p>
            Down the tunnel, just a bit out of reach, a small, pink flower 
            blooms off the tunnel wall.
