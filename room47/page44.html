        <h2>You swim out into vast emptiness.</h2>

        <p>
            The further you go, the more it feels like swimming and not just 
            wading through a pile of plushies. Eventually, you are soaked 
            through. Still, you press on. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually, the infinite horizon is broken by a curved white 
            shore. You approach it, and climb over the ridge. You find 
            yourself tumbling over the edge of a 470 ml soda cup, onto the 
            floor of a fast food establishment.
