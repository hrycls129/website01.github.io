        <h1>"You Cannot Escape Room 47"</h1>

        <p>
            The message is scrawled in black paint over what you thought was 
            the door to this room, the 47th room of the 47th floor. Upon
            closer inspection, you realize that the door itself is actually 
            painted onto the wall. Curious. Didn't you just come through 
            there?
