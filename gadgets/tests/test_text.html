        <h1>Heading practice</h1>
        <p>There are six levels of heading within HTML. We will demonstrate them here.</p>

        <h1>This is the first heading</h1>
        <h2>This is the second heading</h2>
        <h3>This is the third heading</h3>
        <h4>This is the fourth heading</h4>
        <h5>This is the fifth heading</h5>
        <h6>This is the sixth heading</h6>
        <p>There are no further headings.</p>

        <h2>
            Colours
        </h2>

        <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
        <p style="color:blue;">This is a blue paragraph.</p>

        <h2>
            Text sizes
        </h2>

        <h3 style="font-size:60px;">Headings can have different sizes.</h3>
        <h1 style="font-size:20px;">This is a large heading with a small size.</h3>
        <p style="font-size:60px;">Text can have different sizes.</p>
        <p style="font-size:70px;">This is normal text with a large size.</p>

        <h2>There can be line breaks in html</h2>
        <p>There should be a line break under here.</p>
        <br>

        <p>There can also be line breaks within paragraphs.</p>

        <p>There <br>is <br>a <br>break <br>after <br>each <br>word <br>here.</p>

        <pre>
            Text can also come preformatted.

            It will be displayed in a fixed-with font like Consolas or Courier.

            This can help with formatting, but may look less than appealing.
