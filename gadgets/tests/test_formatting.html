        <h1>Text Formatting</h1>

        <b>This text is bold</b>

        <strong>
            This text is "Strong," which is used to denote important stuff.
            Usually, the text inside is displayed in bold. 
        </strong>
        <br>
        <i>This text is italic</i>
        <br>
        <em>
            This text is empahsized. A text reader will pronounce it 
            differently. It is usually displayed in italics.
        </em>
        <br>
        <small>
            This text is small.
        </small>

        <p>
            Some text here is <mark>highlighted</mark>. I also want to know if 
            I can <mark style="color: #9767B0;">highlight</mark> in different 
            <mark style="color: #AE2869;">colours</mark>. Turns out, it just 
            changes the colour of the text.

        <p>
            The "del" element in html identifies text that has been 
            <del>deleted</del>. Deleted text usually appears with a line 
            struck through it.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The "ins" element in html identifies text that has been 
            <ins>inserted</ins>. Inserted text usually appears with an 
            <ins>underline</ins>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The "sub" element in html identifies text that is subscripted. For 
            example: H<sub>2</sub>O.
        </p>

        <p>
            the "sup" element in html indentifies text that is superscripted. 
            For example: x<sup>2</sup>.
